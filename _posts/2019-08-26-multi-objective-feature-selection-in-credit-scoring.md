Multi-Objective Feature Selection in Credit Scoring was the title of my Master thesis at Humboldt University of Berlin. The thesis describes a new feature selection approach based on a multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm. An implementation of the [Multi-Objective NSGA-III algorithm for feature selection](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nsga3/index.html) in R programming language was presented as a part of master thesis and published at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). This article presents a brief overview of the proposed approach as well as key findings.
